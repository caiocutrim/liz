> `./lib/Liz/Core`

Contain the structure that pick up the pieces of MVC. Leave this folder in peace :)

> `./public`

Put your JS, CSS, Fonts, Images and multimedia files here

> `./src/App`

Your Application will be developed in this folder.

1. `Bootstrap.php` - Don't edit this file unless you know what you are doing!
2. `Configs` folder - put your configurations in this folder
3. `Controllers` folder - the controller file name and the classes should be the same name using CamelCase style
4. `Layouts` folder - contains the html code that should be used for structures that repeat
5. `Models` folder - the model file name and the classes should be the same name using CamelCase style
6. `Views` folder - the folder inside have the name of the called controller and the file (into the folder) have the name of Action (Controller's method). The file content is HTML

## Controllers

Create the controllers in the folder `./src/App/Controllers`. Follow example:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Controllers;

use Liz\Core\Controller;    

class Example extends Controller
{    
    public function index()
    { 
    	# code
    }
}
```
    
> `ps:` This Controller automatically show the View located at `./src/App/Views/Example/Index.phtml`

## Models
Create the models in the folder `./src/App/Models`. Follow example:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Models;

use Liz\Core\Model;

class ModelTest extends Model
{
	public function someFunction()
	{
		# code
	}
}
```

To call this model in some Controller follow the steps:

1. Declare `use App\Models\ModelTest` in your Controller
2. Just instantiate the model in function `$model = new ModelTest()`

## Views

You can put your HTML combined with small pieces of php (passed by Controller, or not :)
